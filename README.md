CSharpConsoleIntro
==================

This is a short tutorial working with the console I created for 12 and 6 year old sons, Luke and Jake

The ConsoleIntro project is intended to teach children (primarily my sons Luke, 12, and Jacob, 6)
some of the basics of C# programming. It consists of several different modules that a child can 
execute and modify to start understanding the basics. It is intended to be done side-by-side with an adult,
such as a parent, so it makes a lot of assumptions that you are having a conversation, and not just sitting your
kid in front of a computer and saying 'Here, learn to program.'

It's important to remember that this is designed for children, so readability should take precedence over
elegance
  
1)  A basic 'hello world' program
2)  a program which reads name from standard ninput and greets accordingly
3)  basic variable use
4)  current date and time
5)  Simple maths
6)  sequential printing - really primitive logic/algorithm foo
7)  more math + standard input foo

The idea for this (and the inspiration for a lot of these exercises) come from 
"Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#", Nakov, et. al., 2013. Very good book, and they deserve a lot 
of credit.

You are free to modify, copy, or otherwise fuck with this all you'd like. It would be nice to get credit,
but it's not like this is some huge accomplishment, so if not it's no big deal. If we ever meet at a 
conference or something and you buy me a beer, that would also be cool. 

And also, monkeys rule. You may not use this software if you don't acknowledge this fact.
